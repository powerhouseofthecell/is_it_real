A simple demonstration of Binary Classifiers with Keras and Tensorflow

-----
## Intro
Hello! This is a simple introduction to the binary classifier, a machine learning model which outputs which category, of two, and input is in. These categories are also known as labels, and can sometimes be extremely useful, even with only two. In this example, we will be seeing if a simple model we build can easily distinguish between what is a real photograph and what is a cartoon.
